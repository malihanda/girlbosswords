This is a "try to hack away at my ever-growing list of 15 seeds" kinda puzzle. Hope you enjoy!

Many, many, MANY thanks to [Ken](https://twitter.com/ckstern), [Paolo](https://twitter.com/gpaolopasco), and [Rachel](https://twitter.com/faBioethics) for test solving this one! The puzzle you're seeing is so much tighter than the first draft.
