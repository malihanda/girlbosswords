Today's puzzle is a collab with [already-honorary-girlboss](/puzzle/guest-rafamusa-1.html) [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafaxword)! I'm so thrilled that he allowed me to fill in the other half (two-fifths, really) of this grid... for a fun time, guess which side was his and which side was mine ;) I think this puzzle will be medium if you have the same brain that we do, and hard if you do not. Thanks to [Kate](https://twitter.com/kateschmate) for the test solve!
