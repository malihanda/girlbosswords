hey squad! it's been a little bit since i've posted here. the proliferation of Puzzle Outlets means that usually i can get something published in an outlet.

usually!!

here's a collab with erik that got shopped around a little bit before it ended up here. (we think everyone who rejected it is wrong, btw. we love this puzzle and we know y'all are going to love it too!)
