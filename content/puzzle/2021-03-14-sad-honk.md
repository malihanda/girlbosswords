[Paolo](https://twitter.com/gridsthesedays) hit me up with this puzzle idea and I have never said yes so fast. I felt like this was a good opportunity for grid art, and the layout he came up with could hang in a gallery. We filled this puzzle over Twitter DMs, so @jack please endorse us!! tysm.

I love how fresh [Paolo's puzzles](http://gridsthesedays.blogspot.com/) are, with cluing angles and entries that are so original, it feels like the word "original" is an understatement. (Sometimes I'll just randomly remember [\[Supreme beings?\]](http://gridsthesedays.blogspot.com/2021/02/puzzle-84-themeless-23.html) and say "Nice!" under my breath.) There's some great stuff in this puzzle, and I hope y'all have as much fun with it as we did!
