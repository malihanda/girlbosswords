One reason I like making indie puzzles is because I can make the grid look like whatever I want. (Another reason is because I can write clues that are 239 characters long.) This grid is 23.55% black squares and I think it's very beautiful. It doesn't *quite* have diagonal symmetry, but it's close.

Many thanks to [Neville](https://twitter.com/flyingelevator) and [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafaxword) for test solving this one!
