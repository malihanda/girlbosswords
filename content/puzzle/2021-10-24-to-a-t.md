I love the concept of metas (puzzle within a puzzle!! hell yea!!!!) but I really struggle to solve them. So I tried to make the meta answer pretty accessible in this one. Maybe you could even argue that it is a themed puzzle! I am just hoping to get as many entrants as possible, so if you need a hint, feel free to message me on Twitter. (If you'd like an extra challenge, you could try solving it with no prompt!)

Many thanks to the legendary [Neville](https://twitter.com/flyingelevator) who knows way more about meta puzzles than me and was a great test solver.

Edit, 11/8: Thank you so much everyone for playing! I got 123 submissions, 111 of which were correct. The randomly chosen winner is CAe39, who will receive a free item of their choice!
