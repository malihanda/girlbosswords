I'm really excited to share this puzzle with you! This is a big boi, the largest grid I've filled to date!! <a href="https://www.happylittlepuzzles.com/about" target="_blank">Matthew</a> suggested I make this a 17x and I'm so glad he did because the fill ended up much smoother. But let me tell ya, this grid looked sprawling when I first started.

When you're done solving, please tag yourself. Personally I am 18A.
