This puzzle had been in my head for weeks and weeks and it finally came to fruition during a Thanksgiving food coma.

It doesn't really work on apps, but you can print it out below! And you definitely should. This is one of my fave puzzles.

Rave reviews include:
- "loved the last puzzle!!! \[redacted\] and \[redacted\] is such an iconic crossing top tier" --[david](https://avidpuzzler.blogspot.com/)
- "\[redacted\] crossing \[redacted\] is so choice" --[paolo](http://gridsthesedays.blogspot.com/)
- "I love it" --[neville](https://twitter.com/flyingelevator)
