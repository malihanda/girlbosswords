Today's puzzle is a collab with <a href="https://www.girlbosswords/puzzle/guest-rafamusa-1.html" target="_blank">already-honorary-girlboss</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rafaxword" target="_blank">Rafa</a>! I'm so thrilled that he allowed me to fill in the other half (two-fifths, really) of this grid... for a fun time, guess which side was his and which side was mine ;) I think this puzzle will be medium if you have the same brain that we do, and hard if you do not. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/kateschmate" target="_blank">Kate</a> for the test solve!
