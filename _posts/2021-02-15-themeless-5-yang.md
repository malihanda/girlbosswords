This is a "try to hack away at my ever-growing list of 15 seeds" kinda puzzle. Hope you enjoy!

Many, many, MANY thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ckstern" target="_blank">Ken</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gpaolopasco" target="_blank">Paolo</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/faBioethics" target="_blank">Rachel</a> for test solving this one! The puzzle you're seeing is so much tighter than the first draft.
