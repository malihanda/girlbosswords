I love to peruse themeless grids from my favorite constructors and then try to fill them myself. Usually I have to update a few blocks to make it work-- that's what I did here. This is a copy of <a href="http://gridsthesedays.blogspot.com/2021/08/puzzle-97-themeless-31-with-erik-agard.html" target="_blank">this incredible ea+pp themeless grid</a>, but I cut into that central stack, making it three nine-letter words rather than five. That means this puzzle ends up with nine nines, which is the kind of thing that I really like, but solvers will likely not even notice unless I explicitly call it out. So here I am, calling it out.

Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/sinclaaair" target="_blank">sin, I mean Sinclair</a> and Alex for their test solves!
