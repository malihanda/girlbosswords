Hey folks!! We've got a guest puzzle today from [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafaxword)!! Brief interlude here so we can appreciate his greatest hits on Twitter: [this](https://twitter.com/rafaxword/status/1368989072652345344), [this](https://twitter.com/rafaxword/status/1385712767164850178), [this](https://twitter.com/rafaxword/status/1407754415822446593). Okay cool, back to puzzling. This themeless is super fresh! So many great phrases in here. Happy solving!

Rafa says: "This is the first themeless puzzle I ever made-- I hope you enjoy it! I asked myself, "How many fun colloquial exclamations can I fit into a puzzle?" and then made this puzzle. Huge thanks to [Matthew](https://twitter.com/1MatthewStock) and [Mollie](https://twitter.com/MollieCowger) for test solving and for excellent feedback, and to Malaika for hosting! I recommend solving literally anything that any of them make!"
