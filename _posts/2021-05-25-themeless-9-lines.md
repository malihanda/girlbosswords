What's it called when you have a stack but it's vertical entries? To me, stack implies one on top of the other, rather than side-by-side entries. Can we call these pillars? While we're talking about crossword terminology, I'll be using <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianaTringali/status/1395047490303369219" target="_blank">"themie"</a> moving forward (rather than "themer") and encourage y'all to do the same.

Other things that are new in 7xwords land: If you are the kind of person who likes to say "thank you for running this project" in a $$$ way, you can now do that <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/malisolves" target="_blank">over here</a>! This is one thousand percent optional, obviously, but I did have a few requests for it, so now it exists.

Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/1MatthewStock" target="_blank">Matthew</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kateshawkins" target="_blank">Kate</a> for their initial thoughts on this grid, which led me to refill some spots, and <a href="https://twitter.com/molliecowger" target="_blank">Mollie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KPat95" target="_blank">Kevin</a> for doing a full test solve of the final puzzle, and helping me nail down some clues. Whoa, I just realized those are both M/K pairings. Anyway, hope you enjoy!
