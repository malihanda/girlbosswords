What's it called when you have a stack but it's vertical entries? To me, stack implies one on top of the other, rather than side-by-side entries. Can we call these pillars? While we're talking about crossword terminology, I'll be using ["themie"](https://twitter.com/JulianaTringali/status/1395047490303369219) moving forward (rather than "themer") and encourage y'all to do the same.

Other things that are new in 7xwords land: If you are the kind of person who likes to say "thank you for running this project" in a $$$ way, you can now do that [over here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/malisolves)! This is one thousand percent optional, obviously, but I did have a few requests for it, so now it exists.

Many thanks to [Matthew](https://twitter.com/1MatthewStock) and [Kate](https://twitter.com/kateshawkins) for their initial thoughts on this grid, which led me to refill some spots, and [Mollie](https://twitter.com/molliecowger) and [Kevin](https://twitter.com/KPat95) for doing a full test solve of the final puzzle, and helping me nail down some clues. Whoa, I just realized those are both M/K pairings. Anyway, hope you enjoy!
