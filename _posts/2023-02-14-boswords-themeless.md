I was a constructor for the lovely Boswords fall themeless league, which involves writing three sets of clues for a themeless puzzle. Like all published puzzles, then an editor goes through and updates things for consistency and precision.

This version of the puzzle has just one set of clues-- I picked my favorite one for each entry. And sometimes I picked one that the editor had completely cut because he felt it was imprecise. The resulting puzzle is completely chaotic. I hope you have fun!
