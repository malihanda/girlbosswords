Quick lil themeless today! Kinda leaned into the "The Whole Point Of Indie Puzzles Is I Can Write Whatever Clues I Want" situation so I hope you enjoy that, or learn something. There's unchecked squares in this... not for any reason! Just kinda felt like ignoring crossword conventions / idk was feeling nihilistic or whatever.

Many thanks to [Wouter](https://twitter.com/WoutervD) for a super quick test solve!
